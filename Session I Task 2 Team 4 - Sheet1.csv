,,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/) to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
