,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/) to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human Brain Project,"The Human Brain Project aims to put in place a cutting-edge research infrastructure that will allow scientific and industrial researchers to advance our knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing, and brain-related medicine ",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,48,"HDB shows its openness especially through their main network called EBRAINS. EBRAINS offers a world-class e-infrastructure for brain research, providing tools, services and data for neuroscientists. Its accessibility shows itself through an accessible mobile version. Almost all data and knowledge are accessible to all for free through their platform.

HBP is the first to appear on the google page which makes its discovery easy. On top of that, HBP is omnipresent in the news. Indeed, the HBP has been featured in BBC News, Bloomberg, Euronews, and many other prestigious publications: prints, tv/videos, and podcasts

Co-funded by EU, the HBP is very transparent. The structure of the current HBP governance is shown. The structure design allows the Core Project (CP) to run efficiently and transparently.

Their website allows open access to 1498 Publications as well as tutorials, youtube videos, a help section, and the use of analogy to make the content more comprehensible to non-researchers for example. Indeed, they are not only targetting the scientifc community but science citizens as well through their social media platforms, open newsletters, and events. 


",The open calls allow partners to take part of the work but no direct information about the peer review itself is available.,
Event Horizon Telescope,"Their objectives are to image the black hole, testing General Relativity, Understanding Accretion Around A Black Hole, and Understanding Jet Genesis and Collimation.",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,48,"EHT sees itself going over the NASA in the google search ranking regarding black holes. It provides open data through publications in different languages: English through the official press of EHT collaboration and additional information in English and in other languages can be found in the press releases from their partner institutions.

They provide DOI links, data products code, and references allowing easy reusability and reproducibility.

Regarding the research community, an international group of researchers can evaluate the work. Feedback can be sent directly on their website allowing non-researchers to take part of their work. Indeed, meetings, events, a blog, and FAQ are available for the public good. ","Regarding the collaborative aspect, only lists of affiliated institutes, industry donors and funding support are available but no further details and explanations can be found on their website.

Science Feedback,"Science Feedback is a not-for-profit organization verifying the credibility of influential claims and media coverage that claims to be scientific, starting with the topics of climate and health.",5,3.5,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,"45,5","Science Feedback provides open reviews for the good of every internet user.
They openly share publications through links of google scholars articles joined to each reviewer of the team.
Besides, anyone can become a reviewer following their own methods or do the same independently (reproducibility).
They also mention their review methods which foster transparency.
Finally, anyone can contact them through the platform if one notices an error or has relevant information to add.","By entering keywords such as ""science fact"" or ""fiction science"" one may have difficulty finding their website. Still, the name of the organization itself (""science feedback"") plays a key role to get their website in the first position on google search. ", 
Open Worm,Develop a computational model of a worm (C.elegans) based on previuos experiemntal data. ,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,3,44,"It is among the first sites displayed when looking for neural simulations in Google. Once in the site, the information is very well structured and organized (there is even a page with the whole story on how the project has evolved through time) and tabs are intuitive to use. In addition, all the documentation and code is available online (in their website and Github account) and they even provide all the data sets used so far with detailed description. Therefore, it is possible to reproduce the project or modify it and build upon it.Open Worm seems really commited into Open Science, even the logo is available for people to use it.","Feedback is accepted via email or social media, yet it would be great if they had a specific place with all the feedback that has been provided, in order to learn from it. Also, even though they collaborate with academia, it is not clear who are the real stakeholders and how they are being involved and beneficted from the research process.  Research outcomes from Open Worm can help to simulate and understand the human brain, however this is not further explained in their site. ",
Safecast,"Gather environmental data and share it under a public domain. Safecasts goal is to ""to provide citizens worldwide with the tools they need to inform themselves by gathering and sharing accurate environmental data in an open and participatory fashion""",5,4,5,5,5,5,4,3,5,4,45,"SafeCast They publish articles on how the project is evolving and what have they been doing. This makes it easy to follow discussion about the project and provide feedback. Safecast provides all the data collected and the progress of the devices they are working with. They have videos explaining how the devices work, which makes it eally easy to replicate. The Hardware is open source and data can be used by anyone, you just need to cite them. It is easy to hack the codes and reprogram the devices, also the environmental data provides useful information to draw new research on. Devices and information about the collection of data is avilable, hence you can easily reproduce it. ","The site was not that easly found in Google when looking for terms related to world wheather data, yet once in the site it is easy to follow. The interactive platform to visualize the data collected is nice and videos on how the devices work are useful, yet some of the information of the site is in languages different from english which is great to include more people but can be a bit confusing. Data is collected in a collaborative manner, yet we could not find partnerships with other organizations related to the topic",
SenseBox,"Toolkit based on microcontrollers and programming for digital education, citizen science and environmental monitoring",3,4,5,5,2,4,3,4,3,4,37,"- The website allows users to recreate what they have made by providing the resources, details about the hardware components, and the code requirements that are required to replicate the product. Additionally, the few projects that have been provided on the website also allow users to recreate them. The information is categorised into 3 sections based on the user group and their needs which makes it easy for users to find the sensebox they require. There are also many projects and papers that one can refer to to do their own research. Website provides good resources for collaboration such as feedback, a forum, but the community is limited. 

- They were cited in 12 scientific papers as well as many bachelor's and master's thesis papers

- The website has an FAQ section which answers the 5 W's as well as includes details about who funded it. However this section is quite difficult to find and is embedded within another section of the website","- The hardware components could be made more affordable as currently it is on the more expensive side. Considering it is an open science platform, the product in itself needs to be accessible to people of different financial backgrounds as well. 
- The site and the product instructions could also be made available in different languages. 
- More projects could be added on the website
- Lastly, the website could be chunked a bit better in order for one to easily be able to find the information they are looking for without going into sub pages.",
Kiron ,Online platform to access free courses to build skills ,3,5,1,3,2,5,5,5,4,5,38,"- The website offers good quality content for free for those from vulnerable populations and allows them to build skills in various different areas. The website is quite clear about how the process works and helps you create a clear visual upfront. They are also transparent about their funding and stakeholder information. Your information is relatively visible on social networks such as facebook, twitter and instagram. In addition, through google search engine, it is easily found by keywords. ","Considering the platform is made for the refugee population, it is very possible that these people may not have good access to internet. The intention of the platform might be fully met only when they also start offering scholarships for tech support to these students or a find a way around solving the limited tech accessibility issue.",
